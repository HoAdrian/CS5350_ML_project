# Instruction
* The data folder should be contained in the current directory
* each learning algorithm has its own folder, which contains the implementation, the figures and the submissions
* perceptron.py, svm.py, logistic_regression.py, adaboost.py, bagging.py contains the implementations of the machine learning models. The main method in these files train the model with the specified hyperparameters. 
* The cross_validation.py in each folder for algorithm A does cross validation for that algorithm. 
* To train a model for a dataset with different feature (e.g. spacy-embedding, tfidf, roberta), modify the feature_type variable in the main method of the code.


## How to run the code on CADE
* make run.sh executable and executes run.sh.
